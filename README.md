# Jabroni Brawl SRCDS Scripts

This is the configuration I used to run the `24/7 Killbox Deathmatch, No Mutators [EU]` SRCDS server for [Jabroni Brawl: Episode 3](https://store.steampowered.com/app/869480/Jabroni_Brawl_Episode_3/). 

The setup is fairly simple and involves only one server, it doesn't have fancy admin panels or anything. This can probably achieved better with modern SRCDS management tools, but at the time of game release, weren't available or compatible with JBEP3 SRCDS. I hope this small data dump can act as some sort of reference on how a SRCDS can be used. 

## jbep3 scripts and configs

See folder [`jbep3`](jbep3) for the scripts and game server configs, and a general overview and explanation on how to set it up. 

## Munin plugin

I wrote a small plugin for Munin to track player numbers, see folder [`munin-srcds`](munin-srcds).
